On his way, he passed through the town where Damodardas lived. Damodardas, father had recently passed away, and left his money to Damodardas and his three brother but Damodardas was unconcerned about such matters because his mind was absorbed in the thoughts of his future guru, Shri Mahaprabhuji. When Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya passed on the main street Damodardas, balcony, he immediately went to the street below and bow at the feet of his guru and took initiation.  The Lord then disappeared and Shri Mahaprabhuji awoke his disciples and silently left his uncle\u2019s house. The next morning, Shri Mahaprabhuji order his Kamandal {a type of water pot made out of a type of pumpkin} t proceed to the conference hall and notify all of his arrival. His kamandal then flew into the great hall room and everyone present there stood up and the king told the kamandal to brign his master to the conference. Later, when Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya arrived there shinning like countless suns, King Krishnadeva Raya bowed at his feet. Within a very short time, Shri Mahaprabhuji defeated the Mayavadians with his teaching of Brahmavada, that everything is God and nothing but God. The king then present Mahaprabhuji with 600 I bs of gold and honored him with a sacred bath. Shri Mahaprabhuji distributed the gold to all the Brahmins and when he made the king his disciple he was offered a large tray of gold coins. Shri Mahaprabhuji took only seven of those coins and later offered them to Lord Jagannath. The head of the Madhva lineage then requested Shri Mahaprabhu to take over his religious seat, but Shri Mahaprabhuji considered that his appearance was to establish the Vishnu Svami who once told me, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s service is our only interested in their own pleasure. The Lord does as he pleases, we can only follow His wishes\u2019  \u201cOnce the Lord told Vishnu Svami that the Lord would appear as Shri Vallabhacharya and that he will establish the path of Devotion. Vishnu Svami told me when he left for the divine abode that I should stay and head the Vishnu Svami lineage till you come her and defeat the Mayavadians. For the past 750 years I have been thinking about you.\u201d Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya then accepted the leadership of the Vishnu Svami lineage and Bilvamangal ascended to the eternal abode before the entire assembly. Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya stayed in Vidhya Nagar for a few days giving discourse at the royal palace before proceeding onwards. ",

After bathing in ;the chipra river, he said to Damala, \u201cThis place is sacred to Lord Shiva. To uplift the divine souls here, I should speak the Shirmad Bhagavatam. The only problem I foresee is that there is no shady place to hold the discourse. Damala replied, \u201cIf you want, you can make a forest so to find one tree should not be very difficult.\u201d  Early the next morning, after Shri Mahaprabhuji had taken his bath he noticed a huge shady pipal tree in the place where he had sprinkled the water the previous day. Taking his seat under the tree he began the \u201csaptah\u201d. The local prople who came to bath in the Gomati lake were very surprised to see the huge tree which had grown ;to be several hundred years old in the course of a single night. The Mayavadians who lived there heard of Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya\u2019s arrival but were afraid to even stir out.  Lord Shiva had two great devotees there. One day, after Shiva had gone to hear Shri Mahaprabhuji he told two of his close followers, \u201cIt was the Lord\u2019s wish for me to incarnate as Shankaracharya in order to establish the theory of the Mayavada, but now it is the Supreme Lord\u2019s wish to show the supremacy of devotion. The Lord has incarnated as Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya and tomorrow I will go hear him. Accompany me if you wish.\u201d  After the reading of the Shrimad Bhagavatam was completed, Shri Mahaprabhuj request Shiva to call all the Mayavadians for a religious debate and that night Shiva appeared in all the Mayavadians dreams and told them to fearlessly face Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya. The following day, they all came and Shiva secretly took his seat to watch the debate. Shri Mahaprabhuj proved to everyone there that Brahmavada was the essence of Vedic thought and the Mayavadians received initiation from Shri Mahaprabhuji. Seeing this pastime, Lord Shiva privately apporoached Shri Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya and said, \u201cI thought that you would defeat them through scriptural debate, but you were victorious over the Mayavadians through your own divinity.\u201d ",

            <p>Vallabhacharya was a 15th-century philosopher who founded Pushti Marg, a path of devotion within the Hindu Bhakti movement. He was born in Rajasthan, studied in Varanasi, and went on a pilgrimage across India before settling in Mathura. There, he established a temple dedicated to Lord Krishna and taught the importance of bhakti and divine grace. Today, he is revered as a saint and philosopher, and his followers continue to practice the Pushti Marg (path).
